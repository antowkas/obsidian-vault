# obsidian-vault
This is my personal knowledge repository inspired by the Zettelkasten method. It contains structured notes, ideas, and materials that help me organize and deepen my understanding of various topics.

Features:
- Linked notes for more in-depth topic exploration.
- Compact and concise structure for quick navigation.
- Continuously updated and evolving content.

I use this vault as a tool for learning, research, and reflection.
